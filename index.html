      <h3>3- Architectural engineering</h3>
      <p>Architectural engineers apply science and technology to the real world by designing buildings that enhance our standard of living and improve our quality of life. They do this by combining building systems â€“ structural, electrical, mechanical, lighting, acoustics and fire protection - into an integrated whole.</p>
